What to Expect : 

Language: The official language of Cuba is Spanish, with about 90% of its population speaking it as their first language.

Currency: The official currency of Cuba is the Cuban Peso (CUP) though they also use the Cuban Convertible Peso (CUC). 1 USD is equivalent to 1 CUP.

Credit Cards & ATMs: At the moment, no US credit or debit card can be used in Cuba. This also includes using a US debit card to try to get cash out of a Cuban ATM. However, if you are using a card from somewhere else, like Canada or Europe, it’s likely your card will work, but you will run into a 3% charge for every payment. Cuba does have an expanding network of ATMs, but don’t expect a US-issued card to work with the machines. Any other country issued card will work just fine but again, expect a hefty fee.

Plugs: In Cuba, the power plugs are type A, B, C, and L, the standard voltage is 110 / 220 V, and the standard frequency is 60 Hz. I recommend buying a universal adapter (make sure it has surge protection) and using a converter for hairdryers and hot tools.

Safety: As a whole, Cuba is generally safer than many other countries, with violent attacks being rare. Petty theft, especially at the beach or in hotel rooms, can be common but small preventative measures work wonders. The same goes for pickpocketing.
