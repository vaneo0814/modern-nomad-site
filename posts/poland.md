To save you from reading an elaborate intro, I’m just going to cut to the chase. Today I'm sharing all of the things I wish I had known before travelling to Poland. From things I wish I had researched better, to things I wish people had told me and things I hope will help anyone headed to this beautiful country. Because if you love to travel but could do without Europe's overrated destinations, you'll be pleasantly surprised in Poland.

#1. THEY DON'T USE EURO IN POLAND
I should have known that, despite being in the European Union, Poland does not use euro. The national currency in Poland is złoty (pronounced zwoty) and a quick google search would have told me so. Instead, I didn't find out until the night before we left for Poland which, I'll admit, was a rookie mistake. Złoty is abbreviated as PLN or zł and groszy is the equivalent to cents in Poland. The odd hotel or restaurant may accept euro or dollars but ATM's and exchange counters can be found throughout the country so you won't have a problem getting local currency.

#2. YES, THEY SPEAK ENGLISH
After their native tongue, English is the second most common language spoken in Poland. It's taught in schools and almost anyone working in the tourism industry of a big city speaks English to some degree. You may not hear it in small towns and among older locals but you'll get by just fine in the country's top tourist destinations. And while I can attest to the fact that many speak English, I've also witnessed that, if asked, many pretend not to understand when shy or afraid to reveal their accent. I heard "Sorry for my bad English" quite often despite their English being much better than my Polish.

#3. MILK BARS ARE NOT BARS THAT SELL MILK
Ok, you can't blame me for assuming here! Contrary to the name, milk bars (or bar mleczny in Polish) are affordable, cafeteria-style restaurants that you'll find throughout Poland. In the past, milk bars were subsidized by the government for workers but today you can visit one and find complete, homemade-style meals for as little as $2-3 CAD. Our visits to milk bars included a lot of guesswork and some miming but it's an experience we would recommend to anyone travelling to Poland.

#4. YOU WILL DRINK MORE THAN JUST VODKA
Another stereotype we've all heard is that Polish people only drink vodka. And, while we did have our fair share in Poland, there is more to be enjoyed. Like beer. Often ranking in the top 10 for world's biggest beer drinkers, beer is no joke in Poland. Žywiec and Tyskie aside, there's an impressive craft beer scene growing in cities all over the country. I was pleasantly surprised to nearly always find a local IPA in bars, eateries and grocery stores. It's worth noting that, unlike neighbouring Germany and Czechia, drinking in public is not allowed in Poland. This is also where Wes and I first got a taste of kompot: a deliciously sweet beverage made with fruit and served either hot or cold (depending on the season).

#5. MAKE TIME TO TRAVEL BEYOND WARSAW
If Poland has made it's way on to your travel list, you've likely made plans to visit Warsaw. Maybe even Krakow. I'd really encourage you to make time for some of the other well-preserved cities though. In my opinion, Wroclaw, Poznan and Gdansk are worthy of making their way onto a first-timer's itinerary. If it weren't for the dozens of recommendations we were getting from viewers, we might not have had the chance to discover so many of Poland's beautiful cities.

I hope this helped my fellow backpackers and world travelers!
