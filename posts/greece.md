 Looking to get a good tan in Greece? Check out my top three favorite beaches listed down below: 

 Elafonissi, Crete

 The best beach in Greece: Elafonissi on the south coast of Crete. There isn’t much else nearby besides a few small hotels so most people do a day trip from Chania or Rethymnon. Recommended Beach Hotels: Elafonisi Resort by Kalomirakis Family • The wonderful town of Paleochora is a one hour boat ride away. 
  Mylopotas Beach, Ios

  Wonderful sand and a quick drop-off for people who like to swim. Stay at either Mylopotas Beach or in the fun main town (Chora) up on the hill (lots of nightlife if you want it, easy to avoid if you don’t). 

  Plaka Beach, Naxos

  Naxos has many great beaches and if you’re looking for an island with a large variety of beaches it should be at the top of your list. Naxos Town is wonderfully charming and St George beach (a short walk away) is a great town beach. But down the southwest coast there are many others that are even better: Agia Anna, Agios Prokopios, Mikri Vigla, Pyrgaki – and perhaps the best of the lot, Plaka Beach. I recommend staying in Naxos Town and taking the frequent buses to the beaches down the coast.

  (Dont forget to eat souvlakis till you cant no more!)
