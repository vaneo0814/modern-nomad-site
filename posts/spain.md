Madrid, my second home. I have lived, studied and worked there for in total one year, and I have visited the city 10 times. Everyone is always talking about Barcelona, but believe me, Madrid is just as much fun! In early May I visited this nice place with friends N. and S., with whom I also lived here, and it felt like we had never left the city.

#1. Harina – The best Spanish breakfast of Madrid!
Want to have a real Spanish breakfast? Visit Harina! Delicious bread and fine spreads. There are several locations, I prefer the terrace at Plaza de la Independencia! You can find branches of this restaurant in the Salamanca, Chueca, Tetuan districts in Madrid.

#2. Museo del Jamon – Budget-proof breakfast in Madrid
Are you on a small budget? Then visit one of the many branches of Museo del Jamon. This is typical Spanish, a butcher with huge serrano ham in the shop windows. For just one euro you can buy good sandwiches with fresh serrano ham or manchego cheese.

#3. La Tita Rivera – best breakfast burgers in Madrid
This finely priced restaurant serves mainly burgers. Ask for a table in the courtyard, where you are nicely sheltered but still outside. This restaurant can be found in the Chueca district.

#4. Frida – Hotspot for luxury lunch in Madrid!
This is a hip restaurant with a nice terrace. No tapas, but nicely made one-person dishes. This restaurant can be found in the Chueca district.

aaaaaaand last but not least!

#5. Lolina Vintage cafe – Bruch in a cool restaurant in Madrid
Lolina Vintage cannot be missed because of the amazing interior. The name says it all, everything inside is vintage. Nice place to go for brunch! This restaurant can be found in the Malasana district.

Buen provecho!
