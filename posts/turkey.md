Wifi can be Spotty & Limited for Foreigners :

Most wifi spots require a European or Turkish number to get the passcode to access the free wifi. This includes the Istanbul airport; a critical issue to be aware of since you may need to get your online visa when you land at the airport. The best way around this is to have an international phone plan, get a Turkish SIM card, or have a friend with a Turkish number who can spot you the passcodes to get online.

At hotels and Airbnbs, I found that the internet would drop constantly. It was frustrating when I had work to do but would have to grab my laptop and go restaurant hopping until I found a stable connection. So while the internet/wifi in Turkey usually works in most places, it’s often too slow and about 15% of my time in Turkey it would just stop working completely.

Weather in Turkey : 

Of course, the weather depends on what part of Turkey you will be visiting. It’s a huge country spanning across two continents with diverse topography. Turkey’s weather ranges from a desert-dry climate to sizzling hot summers to cold snowy winters. Northeastern is generally colder, the center (close to/west of Cappadocia) is desert hot/cold, and the Mediterranean area including Istanbul has hot summers and mild winters.
